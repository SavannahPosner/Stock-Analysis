# VBA Challenge

### Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

The purpose of the Module 2 challenge was to rewrite the VBA code pertaining to the analysis of the stocks provided by Steve. This is meant to be done in a way that would become more applicable to change and be able to handle a larger data set, allowing for more information to be analyzed. Throughout this process students work through a guided practice. The benefit in this module is largely credited to the module pushing students to figure out how to use tools learned throughout the module in new ways that had not been previously explained. This broadens the student’s understanding of the usage of the tools learned. 

### Results

#### Stock performance between 2017 and 2018

During the year 2017, all the stocks, with the exemption of “TERP”, all have a positive return rate. In fact, half of the stocks have a return rate either equivalent to, or higher than 50.0%. Out of those six stocks, four of them have return rates higher than 100.0%.

During the year 2018, all the stocks, with the exemption of “ENPH” and “RUN”, have negative return rates. However, 33.3% of the stocks have return rates greater than -10.0%. The positive return rate for the year 2018, is 16.7%, those stocks being “ENPH” and “RUN”. The remaining half of the stocks’ return rates lie between -16.3% and -62.6%. 
	
Throughout the two years two stocks had a positive return rate. Those stocks are “ENPH” and “RUN”. Out of the two stocks, “ENPH” proved to be more consistent in it’s return rate at 129.5% in 2017 and 81.9% return in 2017, while “RUN” had a return rate of 5.5% and in 2018 had a return rate of 84.0%.
#### Execution Times 
 The execution time of a piece of code is one way to measure its efficiency. When code becomes more and more complex, the execution time can influence the reliability of code. For example, a program like a GPS can become less reliable if the code doesn’t run fast enough to be capable of relaying the information to the driver quick enough to keep up with the movement of the vehicle. 


The original execution time for 2017 was .61 seconds and for 2018 it was .61 seconds.

After the code was refracted, the execution time for 2017 was .09 seconds and for 2018 it was .09 seconds.

### What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code? 
In terms of advantages, the most obvious advantage is the decrease in time, consequently improving the efficiency of the of code. Another advantage includes the shortening the amount of code presented to the programmer or program editor. Refracting the code also provides the code with the opportunity to make the code more mailable for larger inputs of information. 

A potential disadvantage can arise when refracturing the code, the code can become more difficult to understand. It doesn’t necessarily mean it will be more complicated to understand, but by combining multiple steps into one can make the code harder to pull apart and understand. However, this step can be avoided by efficient commentary on the process. 


### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
The refractured VBA script clearly decreased the amount of time it took to process the information and made the code more adaptable to larger amounts of information. The disadvantage made earlier doesn’t apply to this code because the process was commented for each step.
